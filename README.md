## Postman Collection
The accompanying Postman collection (found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3644654/RWEcQ1YA "Postman Collection"))
is setup for Unknown IP Candidate integration to the test environment.  It leverages Postman variables in place of 
sensitive credentials and other integration specific fields.  A guide to using Postman variables can be found 
[here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/variables "Postman Variables Guide").
